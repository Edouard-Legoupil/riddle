## riddle  0.0.1

Contribution from Edouard:

 * Added missing parameter documentation for `visibility` in `resource_metadata()`

 * Converted package to dev to [fusen](https://thinkr-open.github.io/fusen) to facilitate the creation of practical examples and unit testing
 
 * Replaced functions suffix `package` with `dataset` in the functions so that the terminology is consistent between what is used in RIDL and what is used in the package... `package_` is actually the terminology used by the API - but not the one used by the interface... strangely... 
 
 * Added some documentation or a less minimal-elitist approach :) - including some doc already created by Ahmadou for https://dickoa.gitlab.io/ridl 
 
 * Added UNHCR package template to build the `pkgdown::build_site()` from [vidonne/unhcrtemplate](https://github.com/vidonne/unhcrtemplate) -  in `_pkgdown.yml`: unhcrtemplate
 
 * Added an Rmd report template to build a rapid overview of all dataset within one or more countries container - just change the parameters to get the correct filters.
